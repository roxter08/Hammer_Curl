Overview: A very simple card match game.
Editor: The rows and columns are dynamic. Since this is a prototype I am using 4 x 4 grid in the game. To try different grids just follow the below steps
1. Open inspector of the Manager gameobject in the GameplayScene.
2. In the GameManager.cs script attached to this gameobject, you will find the Row and Column properties. You can update them accordingly and run the game.
